# BME261
MATLAB and Arduino Code created for BME 261 - Prototyping, Simulation, and Design

Goal of project for BME 261: to design a device that detects freezing of gait in Parkinson's patients, and applies a vibration via motor to alleviate this issue. MATLAB was utilized to determine parameters of data retroactively, whereas Arduino demonstrated real-time results.
